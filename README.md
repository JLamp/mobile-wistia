# Mobile Wistia Prototype
This project is meant to serve as a prototype for how Wistia can work on mobile.

This should be treated as aspirational! We don't need to build all of this all at once, but I'm hoping we can have a conversation about what parts will best to focus on first, and how we can work through any parts that seems particularly hairy.
